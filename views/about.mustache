        <h1>How it all started</h1>

        <p>Attendees of Day 1 of GrowConf2011 this year (plug plug) had the opportunity to participate in the half day ‘Solution Summit’ with other great Startups and VC’s to identify problems and solutions to some the challenges facing us in the Canadian Startup Ecosystem.  Attendees offered up all the problems they faced, broke into groups and spent the rest of the morning creating solutions, and sharing them with the table. These group solutions were then refined until each table could come up with a plan for action and improvement for the Canadian startup ecosystem.</p>

    <p>One of the unique behaviours in the startup community is how open companies are to having other Startups and entrepreneurs share their space for a day or two when they’re in town – it’s a great way to meet new companies, grow your network, and really help out others in the "startup trenches".  One of the problems with Canada that makes this tough is density – we’re all so spread out, and there are not enough startups (yet) that have an area in each city that they converge on. It’s getting way better in Vancouver (Gastown) and Calgary (Inglewood) but let’s face it – it’s still hard to reach out. That’s why we created a product like SharePodz to facilitate an increased exchange of resources so that ideas can meet and collide in such a way that could be found in an "Open Desk Network" infrastructure.  Our key focus when designing SharePodz was to create an online marketplace/registry where people are able to donate time/space/resources in order to create a more cohesive startup ecosystem.  When entrepreneurs are traveling, they will be able to login to SharePodz and find shared workspace or leverage resources and when they have space or resources available they can offer it up in return.</p>

    <h1>When the boy was born, like all Spartans he was inspected...</h1>
    <p>AcceleratorYYC and Node.js Calgary organized a Hackathon where they challenged the Calgary developer and Startup community to come out of the weekend of November 19th, 2011 with a site that would allow Canadian Startups and Startup supporters to offer a desk up for use by the Startup community.</p>

    <p>With the support of GitHub, Joyent, RedBull and Steamwhistle - SharePodz was built.  The developers listed below spent hours of their personal time to build the first release:</p>
